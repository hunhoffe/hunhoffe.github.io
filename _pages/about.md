I am a fourth year PhD student in the computer science department at the University of Colorado, Boulder. I am co-advised by Dr. [Eric Rozner](http://ericrozner.com/) and Dr. [Eric Keller](https://eric-keller.github.io/). I am broadly interested in operating systems, networking, and scalable systems research. In my time at CU Boulder, I've mainly focused on resource management and networking for serverless and other containerized cloud workloads. I am also working with Gerd Zellweger of VMware Research on a distributed operating systems project. I am very generously supported by a 2021 Google PhD Fellowship.

I received my BS in Computer Science and BS in Mathematics from George Fox University (Newberg, OR) in May 2015. After graduation, I worked in public industry for four years before returning to academia.

I am passionate about providing mentorship for newcomers to various areas of computer science. In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my spouse & our pets, jogging, reading, and drawing.
